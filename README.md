# DontSearchInVein
5 Students from Yeshiva University High School for Boys participated in the 2022 Yeshiva University Hackathon, coming in first place!

Every day, nurses around the world face the challenge of finding the correct vein to insert IVs into. Many times, even after finding what they think is the best vein, they miss the vien, sometimes multiple times, both causing stress and a waste of valuable time. 

This project was to fix that problem: create an automated vein finder and IV inserter, to both quicken process and take task off the job of the nurses.

The proof of concept uses a camera and python to find drawn lines on paper which represent veins.

Seperately, there is code is written in Java to move the machine, however at this point it is humanly controlled. The java file expects to be within the FTC control system app, which I didn't include in this repository.
